### Technologies:

#### Github
 - Used github pages and netlify to publish the website

#### Gatsby
 - This is the first project static website I built entirely with Gatsby.

#### GraphQL
 - GraphQL was used to query images and data. It was a challenging process but getting the hang of it was fun.
 
#### React
 - Components and a few plugins were generally built with React.
 
#### Styled-components
 - I had a blast using styled-components and may generally use it for other future projects.

#### Slick-carousel
 - The gallery section was made possible with this plugin.
 
#### Formik + Yup
 - Using Formik was fairly easy to implement although without it writing my own form component would have been somewhat difficult plus Yup was an ease to use for my schema's.
